# About

This app shows all Github repositories (showing only mine is too boring)

Repositories can be found using Search Field and sorted by stars. Filtering by language can be found in the table header.

Any repo can be marked as Favourite (there's a separate page for viewing them). The repository detailed view can be reached by clicking the three dots icon (last column).

Favorites and filters are being stored in the browser's local storage. Github API search requests are cached, so return to the previous results page is instant.
